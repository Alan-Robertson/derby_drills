\subsection*{Paceline Banana}
\label{drill:pacelines/banana}

Skaters begin in a pace line with a relatively constant speed.

The skater at the back should carve through the pace line, at each skater they should attempt a `banana catch', by performing a transition and catching the other skater around the waist with their torso.   

The caught skater should reset in their original position in the paceline.

After passing through the paceline catching skater then becomes the new head of the paceline.

Skaters should communicate which side they are approaching from.
