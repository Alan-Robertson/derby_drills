\subsection*{Buttering the Muffin}
\label{drill:pacelines/buttering}

Skaters begin in a pace line with a relatively constant speed.
The skater at the back should carve through the pace line, making very slight contact with each skater in the line, typically brushing their butt past the other skater's thigh.   
That skater then becomes the new head of the paceline.
