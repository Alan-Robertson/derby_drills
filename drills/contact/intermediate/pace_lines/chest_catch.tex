\subsection*{Paceline Banana}
\label{drill:pacelines/banana}

Skaters begin in a pace line with a relatively constant speed.

The foremost skater should turn around and attempt to chest-catch the second skater in the paceline.
Other skaters should skate around and avoid contact with the blocking pair.
If the second skater evades, they may attempt to block a subsequent skater.

If the entire pace line passes then the blocker should release the other skater.

The blocker and blockee should then reform at the back of the pace-line with the blocker behind the blockee.
