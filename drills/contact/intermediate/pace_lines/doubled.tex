\subsection*{Doubled Pacelines}
\label{drill:pacelines/doubled}
% Pure NRG

This drill starts with two pacelines moving at a slow to moderate pace. 
The pacelines should be of approximately the same length such that skaters are paired along the line. 
Each line should be situated between lanes 1 and 2, and between lanes 3 and 4.

Starting from the back, pairs of skaters should weave through together.
