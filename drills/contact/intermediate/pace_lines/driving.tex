\subsection*{Paceline Driving Out}
\label{drill:pacelines/driving}

Skaters begin in a pace line with a relatively constant speed.
The skater at the back should carve through the pace line, at each skater they should carve into the skater and drive them off the track. 
The driven skater should reset in their original position in the paceline.
The driving skater should avoid going off the track themselves.

After passing though the paceline that skater then becomes the new head of the paceline.

Skaters should communicate which side they are approaching from.


{\it Progression}
Progressions of this drill involve the paceline skaters resisting the driving skater more. 


As another progression - should the driving skater go out themselves then they should recycle to the back of the paceline and begin again.
