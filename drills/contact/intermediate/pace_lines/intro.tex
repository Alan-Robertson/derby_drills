\section*{Pace Lines}
\label{sec:pace_lines}
These drills all involve a single line of skaters moving around the track. 

The core idea is that skaters who are newer to contact only have to consider other skaters approaching from either directly in front, or directly behind them. 
This is easier than pack proximity drills where skaters may be in any direction and moving in any direction. 

It also provides an easy bail out - if the skater leaves the pace line they should have a clear path out of the way, whereas a pack drill may have to contend with other skaters.
