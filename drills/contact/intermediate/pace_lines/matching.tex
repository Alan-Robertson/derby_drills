\subsection*{Matching Pacelines}
\label{drill:pacelines/matching}
% Pure NRG

This drill starts with two pacelines moving at a slow to moderate pace, on opposite sides of the track.
The rear-most skater from each paceline should:

\begin{itemize}
\item Weave through their own line
\item Sprint around the track to the other paceline 
\item Weave through this paceline
\item Reset at the front
\end{itemize}

Skaters should pay attention to the opposite line and attempt to keep the lines relatively synchronised in terms of numbers of skaters, and position on the track.
