\subsection*{Doubled Pace-lines}
\label{drill:pacelines/doubled}
% Pure NRG

This drill starts with two pace-lines moving at a slow to moderate pace. 
The pace-lines should be of approximately the same length such that skaters are paired along the line. 
Each line should be situated between lanes 1 and 2, and between lanes 3 and 4.

Starting from the back, one of the skaters in the pair should be considered the jammer, the other the offence. 
The offensive skater should positionally block one of the pair in front of them, allowing the jammer to weave through.  
The jammer and offense should then switch positions for the next pair.
Upon reaching the front of the line, the pair should switch sides to ensure that they are able to practice from both sides.
