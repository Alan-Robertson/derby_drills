\subsection*{Drill: Approaching Leap Juke}
\label{drill:jump_jukes/approaching_leap}

The drill is set up with the jammer having a 10-20 foot run up on a flat two wall.

The jammer should pick a blocker in the wall to clearly signal as a target (shoulders and hips facing the blocker). 
As they approach the wall the jammer should additionally clearly signal an intention to hit by dropping to get lower.


The jammer's next move depends on the blocker, if the blocker follows them down then the jammer should perform a lateral leap towards the blocker's line, passing them before they can re-establish position. 
This can be combined with any passing footwork such as a side surf, alternating one foot, or just a simple carve.  

Alternatively if the blocker does not brace then the jammer can simply dip a second time and engage the blocker from below their centre of gravity. 


From the hit the jammer can engage a number of styles depending if the hit is just used as a pin, or if it moves into a drive or grapple. 



{\it Progressions}
The main progression for this drill is to add a third blocker and form a three wall.
The jammer should modify their passing footwork to account for the brace potentially intercepting them on a double line attempt.   
Similarly if passing through the seam they should seek to add a secondary movement to deal with the brace.
