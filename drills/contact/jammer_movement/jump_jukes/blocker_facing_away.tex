\subsection*{Blocker Facing Away}
\label{drill:jammer_movement/jump_jukes/blocker_facing_away}

This is a combo drill with a range of different movement options.

The skater should start by approaching the blocker from behind and to the side of them. 
The skater should then perform a jump transition, set up such that their hips are now passed the blocker's, scoring their point.

{\it Combo 1a:}
Having gained position on the blocker, the jammer performs a backwards crossover to accelerate away. 

{\it Combo 1b:}
The Jammer spins towards the blocker, facing forwards and threatening any links in a three wall while gaining position.

{\it Combo 1b:}
The jammer engages their toe stops, and performs a second jump to the other side of the blocker facing in the forwards direction. 
From this position the jammer may then either attempt to pass the blocker, or repeat from the first step.

{\it Combo 1c:}
Instead the jammer performs a jump spin from the toe stop, exposing their back to the blocker and passing them.
