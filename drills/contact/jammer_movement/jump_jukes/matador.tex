\subsection*{Drill: Matador}
\label{drill:jammer_movement/jump_jukes/matator}

This is an evasive drill that is useful for escaping a rundown.


The drill begins with a jammer and a blocker, the jammer has escaped pack out the front and the blocker is attempting to chase them down.
The jammer might start in either lane 1 or lane 4, and the blocker in the obverse.


The jammer should transition and skate backwards, as the blocker comes in for the hit the jammer should leap on their toe stops and transition, coming to both a stop relative to the blocker and jumping out of their way.  


The drill may be performed with a line of jammers and blockers, or with a sequence of blockers spaced around the inside and outside of the track, starting chasedowns on circling jammers.
