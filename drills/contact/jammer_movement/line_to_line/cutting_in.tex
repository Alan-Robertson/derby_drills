\subsection*{Cutting In}
\label{drill:line_to_line_jamming:cutting}

Starting from lanes 1.5 or 3.5 accellerate towards the opposite line.
If starting from stationary, the initial push may involve a toe stop, the rest of the movement must be on skates.
If starting with a roll then aim to start in a fowards direction and carve suddenly towards the opposite line.

Upon reaching the line carve back in. 
This path may be seen in figure \ref{fig:chr_1}.


The drill may be performed with cones or chairs representing blockers.

{\it Progression:} Include a pair of blockers who will track the incoming jammer. The blockers will attempt to remove the jammer from the track, while the jammer should aim to break through the seam, or end engaged pushing back towards the center.
