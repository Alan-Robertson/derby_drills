\subsection*{Disengage and Iterate}
\label{drill:line_to_line_jamming:iterate}

This drill requires two to three blockers.

Starting from lanes 1.5 or 3.5 accellerate towards the opposite line.
Depending on the speed of the jammer, the blockers should start either in line with the jammer and track them, in the middle of the track and intercept them, or waiting on the opposite line for the catch.


If starting from stationary, the initial push may involve a toe stop, the rest of the movement must be on skates.
If starting with a roll then aim to start in a fowards direction and carve suddenly towards the opposite line.

Carve in from that line and engage with the wall.
The blockers should attempt to push the jammer out if they have any outwards momentum, otherwise their goal is to trap and pocket the jammer. 

The jammer should attempt to disengage their hips, and run back to the opposite line, attempting to outpace the blockers.
The jammer may also perform a juke and attempt to run the closer line, at the risk of being hit out by a blocker. 


When approaching the wall, throw in a juke to move the wall away from the intended path.
Then either cut back towards the closer line, or continue towards the opposite line before carving in. 
If carving in 

The drill may be performed with cones or chairs representing blockers.
