\subsection*{Drill: Sideways Line Running}
\label{drill:line_to_line_jamming:line_running}

Not technically a line to line drill, but augments them.

Start at the jammer line in either lanes 1 or 4 facing inwards.

For developing skaters perform fast side shuffles on toe stops, for more experienced skaters perform grapevines. 

Continue around the track performing sideways line runs on each straightaway.

{\it Progression: Momenuntum}
Rather than starting from stationary, we start from rolling.
From the centre of the track, perform a turn around toe stop to reach the line, facing inwards before launching from toe-stops into the grapevine.


{\it Progression: Speed}
To improve speed the skater should focus on having a low stance and maximising their stride rather than the number of toe stop pushes.


{\it Progression: Agility}
Place obstacles in lanes 1, 1.5 and 3.5 and 4, the skater should combine their line runs with jumps, cutting in and cutting out to avoid the obstacles.  

Obstacles may also force the jammer to swap between the inside and outside line, or to the centre.
