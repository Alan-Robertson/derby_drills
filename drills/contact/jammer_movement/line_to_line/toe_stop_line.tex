\subsection*{Cutting In}
\label{drill:line_to_line_jamming:toe_stop_line_run}

This drill requires a blocker

Starting from lanes 1.5 or 3.5 accellerate towards the opposite line.
If starting from stationary, the initial push may involve a toe stop, the rest of the movement must be on skates.

The blocker should accellerate towards the outside line, engaging with their thigh, or backwards.

The jammer should attempt to perform a turn around toe-stop on the line, before cutting back inwards towards the middle, targeting the link between the butt and the brace.     


If the jammer feels that they cannot pass the blocker, they should attempt to juke back past the blocker's committed hit towards the center of the track.
