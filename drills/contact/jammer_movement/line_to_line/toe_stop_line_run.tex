\subsection*{Cutting In}
\label{drill:line_to_line_jamming:toe_stop_line_run}

This drill requires a blocker

Starting from lanes 1.5 or 3.5 accellerate towards the opposite line.
If starting from stationary, the initial push may involve a toe stop, the rest of the movement must be on skates.

The blocker should accellerate towards the outside line, engaging with their thigh, or backwards.

The jammer should attempt to perform a turn around toe-stop on the line, and then run before the blocker reaches.
If the blocker does reach then the jammer should be able to sneak past them.  


If the jammer feels that they cannot manage that they should attempt to juke back past the blocker's committed hit towards the center of the track.
The jammer should avoid back blocks from turning into the blocker, or low blocks from engaging too low.   
Blockers should avoid performing a high block or a back block on the jammer.
Dipping slightly early to give warning of the intended directory
