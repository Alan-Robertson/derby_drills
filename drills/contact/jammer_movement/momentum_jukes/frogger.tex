\subsection{Frogger Drill}

This is a jammer drill in two parts that works best with relatively large numbers of skaters (Approx 15 to 20).

In the first stage blockers begin on track spaced randomly.
The blockers will simply perform laterals while the jammers practice juking.
Blockers should not seek to actively block the jammers, yet.



In the second stage the blockers may attempt to perform 1-on-1 blocks on a jammer.
The jammers should use their momentum jukes to avoid this as they progress around the track.
