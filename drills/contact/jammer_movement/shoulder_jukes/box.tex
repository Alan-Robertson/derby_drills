\subsection*{Box Juke}
\label{tech:shoulder_jukes/box}

As the jammer approaches a blocker, they should begin with both elbows bent and forearms extended as if they were holding a box.   

Once they are close enough they should suddenly mime lifting the box, and placing it to either their left or right, typically splayed in the opposite direction to the facing of their hips.
The effect of this movement is to turn the jammer's torso as if they were about to turn their entire body, with the movement potentially distracting the blocker from the jammer's unchanged hip facing.
