\subsection*{Shoulder Jukes Rolling One on One}
\label{drill:shoulder_jukes/one_on_one}

The jammer should have a 20-30 foot run up, the drill is contrained to either the inside or outside three lanes. 

Beginning with a slow roll, the jammer should approach a solitary blocker. 
The goal is to combine a shoulder juke (of any variety) with a beat followed by a sudden accelleration.  
The initial slow roll is to allow the blocker sufficient momentum to catch the jammer, while also encouraging the jammer to mix a change of pace into their juke.  

Jammer should ensure that they are performing the juke from both sides and that they are mixing up their follow up movement between flipping to the torso side and continuing with their hips.  


{\it Progressions}
The jammer should increase their speed gradually on subsequent approaches.
