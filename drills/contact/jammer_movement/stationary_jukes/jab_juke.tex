\subsection{Jab Jukes}
\label{skill:jab_jukes}

Jab jukes are a simple skill that compose well with more complex manoeuvres. 

The core idea is to threaten an accelerated toe-stop run by placing a foot, but not transferring weight to it, forcing a blocker reaction.  
To sell the movement, at the moment of the jab the jammer should disengage their hips from the blocker, creating a degree of urgency as the blocker believes that they have just lost the jammer and can see the jammer's next move.


From here the blocker has a few options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do nothing, and risk the jammer transferring weight and beginning a toe stop run past the blocker.  
\item Move to block the trajectory suggested by the jab, typically placing the jammer in their blind spot. 
\item Don't twitch and wait for the jammer to commit to a passing movement.
\end{enumerate}

Based on the blocker's movement the jammer's follow up is reasonably simple. 
In the first case the jammer can simply run past the blocker. 
In the second case the jammer can exploit their new position in the blind spot to set up another movement, this time with the blocker both off balance and unable to see what is occurring.
In the third case the play has returned to a neutral state as the blocker did not fall for the jab.
