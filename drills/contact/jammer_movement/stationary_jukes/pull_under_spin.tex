\section{Pull Under Spin}
\label{sec:juke/pull_under_spin}


This technique is designed to leverage the idea that a hip is typically stronger than a thigh when challenging laterals.  


Starting engaged with a wall the jammer performs a pull under while turning 180 degrees, with the goal to roll around one of the butts hip first, blocking off any laterals.
