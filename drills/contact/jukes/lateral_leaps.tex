\section{Lateral Leaps}
\label{sec:juke/lateral_leaps}



\subsection*{Drill: Cones} 
Place a line of cones down the centre of the track.

The goal is to pick a side of the cones and leap laterally as far over them as you can manage, before leaping back.    

For this drill the focus should be on improving distance, not on speed.
