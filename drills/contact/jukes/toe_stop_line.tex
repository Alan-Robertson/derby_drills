\section{Toe Stop Line Jukes}

This juke is best performed from a rolling start, such as on a scoring pass. 


The main line of this juke is to approach either the outside or inside line, turn sideways and perform a toe-stop run along the line.   

The transposition is to instead perform a toe-stop stop, then move to the opposite line.  


To achieve this juke the transition to toe stops should occurr inside the blind spot of the butt closest to the line.  
Performing the transition too early will telegraph which movement the jammer is taking, along with burning off speed. 
To convince the blockers of the jammer's committment to the line it is advised to maintain or even increase speed, and then practice a very sharp toe-stop stop.
