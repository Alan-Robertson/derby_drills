\section{Collapsing Pack}
\label{sec:scenario/collapsing_pack}

The goal of this scenario is to move pack backwards along the track, it requires some mindless assistance of an opposing blocker.  
The defending team should not be told the objective of this drill.


Start with one jammer on the track, a four-wall of defending blockers, and one to two assisting blockers. 
A cone begins 5 feet behind the jammer, representing the furthest non-involved blocker. 

The goal of the offensive blockers is to knock a defending blocker off the track, and recycle them behind the cone. 
Once this is done, both offensive blockers should retreat behind the cone, causing pack to be moved to the back, and resulting in the front wall being rendered out of play. 
The complexity is that this has to be achieved without moving pack to the front, or incurring a destruction penalty by causing a no-pack split situation. 

The defending blockers need to hold the jammer while maintaining pack.  


After a few repetitions of the drill the defending blockers should seek to develop counter-measures.  
The most obvious is that the blocker who is knocked out should simply not return to track.
The next is to allow the jammer to drive the wall as the blockers approach, moving pack to the front and releasing their own hypothetical jammer.
