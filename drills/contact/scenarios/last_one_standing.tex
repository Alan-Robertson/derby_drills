\section{Last Blocker Standing}
\label{drill:scenario/last_blocker_standing}

The drill requires a three or four wall on one team, a single blocker on the other team and either one or two jammers.
If a single jammer, they should be on the same team as the single blocker.

The single blocker's goal is to manipulate pack to tactically trigger destruction or out of play situations to allow their jammer past.
