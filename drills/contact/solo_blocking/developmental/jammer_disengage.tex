\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Jammer Disengage}
\label{drill:one_on_one/developmental/jammer_disengage}

Single jammer and blocker, the jammer begins behind the blocker and engages, driving them forwards.
The jammer will sporadically pull back, testing if the blocker is maintaining their own balance rather than leaning back into the jammer. 
Alternate sides.
