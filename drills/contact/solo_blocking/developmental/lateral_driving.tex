\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Lateral Driving}
\label{drill:one_on_one/developmental/lateral_driving}

Single jammer and blocker, the jammer begins by driving forwards and towards the centre of the track. 
The blocker should perform a lateral movement, driving the jammer towards a line while also moving slightly forwards to avoid a direction of gameplay penalty.

Once the jammer is taken to a line the jammer should switch sides, driving back towards the middle of the track.
The blocker should switch to their other lateral movement, and drive the jammer to the other line. 
 

{\it Progressions:}
One extension of this drill is to allow the jammer the ability to change direction at any time.
The blocker should prepare for the disengage by stopping, and recapturing the jammer.
