\subsection{Sled Run}

This is a variant of the usual sled run, except the sled is a blocker.

Skaters should work in pairs, one skater pushing the other blocking.
Pushers should place their hands on the hips of the blocker and attempt to push them around the track.

The blocker should attempt to resist by stopping. 


{\it Progressions}
If the jammer is having too much success then they should be prohibited from using toe-stops.
If they continue to have too much success then multiple blockers may be added.
