\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Spinning Blocking}
\label{drill:one_on_one/developmental/spinning_blocking}

A one-on one blocking drill, both the blocker and jammer are only allowed to positionally block using spinning movements to juke and momentum jam. 


This focuses on moving between chest catching, banana blocking and regular blocking while tracking the jammer as they disengage their hips through a spin.
