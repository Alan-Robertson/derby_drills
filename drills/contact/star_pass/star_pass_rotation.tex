\section{Star Pass Rotation}
\label{drill:star_pass/rotation}

This drill requires at least 5 skaters, initially three will be blockers, and two jammers.

The goal of this drill is to practice swapping between jamming and blocking, including joining the wall and resetting as needed. 


Begin with one jammer engaged with a three wall.
The jammer should challenge the seam and the lines, but should not be seeking to actively pass the wall.  
The other jammer should start at least 30 feet behind the wall, and begin skating towards the wall.

At the 20 foot mark the engaged jammer should remove the star, pass it to any of the current blockers and join the wall in time to intercept the incoming jammer. 
The blocker that received the star pass should then complete a lap and become the new incoming jammer.

\subsection*{Variant: Chain of Walls}
If there are enough skaters to run multiple groups of this drill, then jammers may rotate into the next wall rather than completing a lap. 


\subsection*{Progression: Jammers Free to Jam}
One progression for this drill is to unconstrain the jammers so that they are no longer facilitating.
If the jammer passes the wall they should then star pass backwards to a blocker and join the wall.
