\subsection*{Look Mum, No Hands}
\label{drill:three_wall/no_hands}

Alternatively known as `Look Ma, No Hands' depending on which side of the english language you reside.

This drill is a basic three wall with one jammer drill except the brace is not permitted to support the butts. 
The brace should drift in what would be a useful position providing communications and at best emotional rather than physical support.  

The drill should begin with the jammer only driving at the seam, with the brace tracking the position of the jammer.


{\it Progressions}
Rather than just driving the seam, the jammer is now free to juke and take lines. 
Unlike a regular two wall drill, the addition of a brace for communications means that the other blockers can hold a better posture.
