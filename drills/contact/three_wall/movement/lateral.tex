\subsection*{Drill: Three Wall Laterals} 
\label{drill:three_wall:laterals}

A drill for developing three wall lateral movements.
Start with three blockers. The wall should seek to move up the track at a slight angle, while all blockers retain their position. 

Blockers should accellerate using lateral movements, and stop to hold the line.
Initially this should focus on moving between the outside and inside lines, but should then be extended to moving to any intermediary lane. 


\subsection*{Progression: Adding a Jammer}
\label{drill:three_wall:laterals:jammer}

The first progression is to add a jammer.
Initially the jammer may only move between lanes 1 and 4, setting the pace at which the wall moves. 
The jammer may challenge the lines on these lanes.
The jammer may also challenge the seams in these lanes - forcing the butts to close the seam.  

Once the wall is comfortable with this, the jammer may begin testing the seam in other lanes, or incorporating jukes.
