\section*{Three walls with Offence}
\label{drill:three_wall/offence}

In groups of five. 
Jammers are free to jam and challenge the wall.
More experienced skaters should perform offence as this session had no prior offence drills.  
Walls should focus on not rotating and not hitting out, while mitigating the impact of the offence.

Wall anti-offence goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid the offence 
\item Block of the offence 
\item Reform 
\end{itemize}
