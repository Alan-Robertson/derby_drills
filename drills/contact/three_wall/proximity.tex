\section*{Three walls in Proximity}
\label{drill:three_wall/proximity}

In groups of eight. 
Six blockers in two teams of three, two jammers.
Jammers are free to jam.
Walls should focus on not rotating and not hitting out.
Walls should also consider using the other wall to zone part of the track. 
Jammers should consider how to use their friendly wall to screen. 
Blockers should swap to Offence once they have lost the jammer.   

Wall Goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintain pack
\item Drive the jammer to a line and hold them there.  
\item Recapture an escaping jammer and reform
\item Hit out an escaping jammer, reset and reform   
\end{itemize}
