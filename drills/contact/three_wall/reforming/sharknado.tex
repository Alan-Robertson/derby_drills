\section*{Sharknado}
\label{drill:three_wall:sharknado}

This drill focuses on reforming a three wall.

Starting with at least three blockers, or six blockers on two teams, mull around between the pivot and jammer line. 
On a signal each group of blockers should attempt to reform a three wall.


\subsection*{Progression: Jammer}
\label{drill:three_wall:sharknado:jammer}


We now add either a jammer, or a pair of jammers for two walls.
The jammers begin at least 20 feet behind the jammer line.
On the signal a jammer is released (if there are two jammers they should decide amongst themselves which jammer is to be released).
The wall should reform and attempt to catch the incoming jammer.
If there are two jammers, then the other jammer should be released a few seconds after the first.  

The drill may end either when both jammers have escaped, or may continue for a few scoring passes.
While the jammer is not in the engagement zone the wall should return to mulling around.


\subsection*{Progression: Offence to Defence Switching}
\label{drill:three_wall:sharknado:o_to_d}

As with the jammer progression, except instead of mulling between scoring passes, the wall should seek to perform a short offensive manoeuvre, before resetting as a three wall.
