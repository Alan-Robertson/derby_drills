\section{Three Wall Rotation}
\label{drill:three_wall/rotation}

A collection of drills that focus on rotating the three wall.


{\bf Common Pitfalls:}
The blocker who swings out along the line will invariably spend part of that movement in an anti-derby direction.  
This invariably leads to the risk of a direction penalty being issued to that blocker.
