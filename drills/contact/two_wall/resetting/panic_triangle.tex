\subsection*{Drill: Panic Triangle}
\label{drill:two_wall/panic_triangle}
% Yoshi

This drill emulates a two wall attempting to catch and control a jammer as they've passed most of the pack.

This drill begins with two blockers and two jammers. 

Between the jammer line and the 10-ft line is a triangle of cones, cornered by the 2nd and 3rd lanes at the jammer line, and the centre of the track at the 10ft line. 
This represents the other three wall in the centre of the track, forcing jammers to have taken a line.

The jammers should begin on the jammer line in either lane 1 or lane 4, while the blockers begin at the 10ft mark in whatever arrangement they see fit.

Another skater announces which jammer is to be released, forcing the wall to respond and catch that jammer. 
At any interval of choice, or once the jammer has escaped, the other jammer is released. 
Once a jammer has escaped they should leave the track, and reset back at the 10ft mark.


{\it: Variants:}
Run a line of jammers, and cycle through all skaters jamming, then rotate the blockers. 

{\it Tips:}
Holding at the 10ft line and then closing into the triangle area will limit the jammer's line options.
