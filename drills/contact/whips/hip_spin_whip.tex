\section{Spin Hip Whip}
\label{sec:whips/spin_hip_whip} 

This is an offensive whip that is initiated on the jammer by a team-mate.


The jammer begins stuck in the seam of a wall.
The offence approaches alongside the wall and takes the jammer's hips from behind.

The offence then spins, hitting one of the butts as they pull their jammer around the side of the wall. 
The manoeuvre is completed by releasing the jammer, and performing a hit or screen on the brace.
