\section*{Leg Whips}
\label{sec:whips/leg_whip}

This drill is included for completeness. In general it is not encouraged to perform this manouvre in a game. 


Hold pose with leg extended behind.
The whip recipient should place one hand over the laces, the other on the heel of the skate.  

The whip-ee should then pull their leg in at the knee, generating a forwards pull. 

The recipient should be incredibly careful not to pull too hard, as there is a high likelihood of pulling the skater performing the whip over in a position in which they cannot place a foot to steady themselves.
For this reason, and for reasons of being in an unsafe position to receive contact there is a high likelihood of injury in performing this technique.
