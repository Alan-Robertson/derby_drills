This document is split into three sections. The first deals with the development of basic skating skills.  
These ephasise technique and form over application to roller derby.
Different skills may be marked as being predicated on other skills, forming a rough progression. 
These form \cref{ch:sticky} to \cref{ch:jumping}. 


The second portion contains derby related drills.
These assume that the skater is familiar with the bulk of the content from the first section, and may make reference to techniques from that section.  


Lastly a selection of sample training sessions is provided.
