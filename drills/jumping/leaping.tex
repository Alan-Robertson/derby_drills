\section{Leaping}
\label{sec:jumping/leaping}

{\it Development of one footed skating (\cref{ch:one_foot}), and edgework (\cref{ch:sticky, ch:stopping, ch:one_foot}) are necessary before attemping this skill.}     

Leaping is a sideways motion.
While skating forwards lift one leg, then using the opposite edges of the trailing foot push the trailing foot off the ground and land on the other leg.   


As with staggered jumping the goal is not to apply any forwards motion.
The existing forward momentum should provide sufficient forwards motion.
