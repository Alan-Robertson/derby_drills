\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Peeling Off} 
\label{drill:crossovers/peeling_off}

Skaters should line up from slowest to fastest.

Begin with the slowest skater performing either one or two laps of crossovers at a comfortable pace (say 60\% of full effort).   
The pack should follow and keep pace with this leading skater.
That skater then peels off and joins the back of the pack. 
The next fastest skater then takes over, at what they would consider to be a comfortable pace.


Skaters that have finished their lap should push themselves to keep up with faster skaters.
If they find that they can no longer keep up, they may go and get a drink.

The drill continues until each skater has led a lap.
