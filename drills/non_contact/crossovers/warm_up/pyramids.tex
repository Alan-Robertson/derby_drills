\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Pyramids}
\label{drill:crossovers/warm_up/pyramids}

This is a common cardio and general fitness drill.

Skaters should form pairs.
One member of each pair should perform \{5, 4, 3, 2, 1\} lap of crossovers, while the other performs a non-derby exercise (such as planks, sit ups, push ups, squats etc).    

Once the skating member has finished their laps, the members swap positions.


{\bf Progression:}
Repeat the drill, in mirrored order this time increasing the number of laps.
