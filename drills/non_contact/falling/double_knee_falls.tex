\section{Knee Falls}
\label{sec:falls/double_knee}

A useful skill for falling.

The goal of this skill is to safely fall on two knees. 

As with the single knee fall, rather than falling directly down, the primary goal should be to burn off speed at an oblique angle. 
The shallower the angle the lessen the impact. 

Unlike the single knee fall we now need to content with two knees falling.
In this situation the goal is to stagger the timing of the impact of the knees. 

As there is a risk of tipping forwards it is advised to lean backwards from the hips in an ersatz rock-star pose.
