\chapter{Falling}
\label{ch:falling}

Skaters will fall over.
Rather than trying to avoid this at all costs, instead we wish to learn to fall safely.


As all falls are relatively similar, we will run the same generic drill for all falls. 


\subsection*{Falling Drill}
\label{drill:falling}

Skaters should skate around the track, on one straight they perform one fall, on the other straight they perform another fall. 
These may be the same fall, or different falls.
