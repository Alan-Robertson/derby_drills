\section{Slide Falls}
\label{sec:falls/slide}

So far the falling drills have assumed that you are falling forwards.
This technique exists for situations where that is not the case.

Our primary goal is to avoid falling either backwards, or directly onto a hip.  
The idea is then to `pick a cheek', to fall onto.  


The fall them maximises contact area along the glutes and thigh, and as with the other falls aims to turn it into a slide.

Falling directly onto your backside may result in a tailbone injury, which is ill advised.
