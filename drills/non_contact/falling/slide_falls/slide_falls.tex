\subsection*{Slide Fall}
\label{drill:falls/slide}

Our primary goal is to avoid falling either backwards, or directly onto a hip.  
The idea is then to `pick a cheek', to fall onto.  


The fall them maximises contact area along the glutes and thigh, and as with the other falls aims to turn it into a slide.

Falling directly onto your backside may result in a tailbone injury, which is ill advised.
