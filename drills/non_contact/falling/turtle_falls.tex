\subsection*{Turtle Falls}
\label{drill:fall/turtle}

While performing double knee falls there was a concern about pitching forwards.
This fall is about managing that situation. 


Here the skater begins with a double knee fall, they then pitch forward making contact with the ground with both their wrist and elbow pads.   
The concern here is how to avoid injury from this position.
The advice is to `turtle' - to assume as small a pose as possible by retracting arms and bringing the head in, while keeping the fingers either clenched or folded out of the way.    

The skater should then re-emerge from their shell once it is safe to do so.
