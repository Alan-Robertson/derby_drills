\section{Drill: Alternating Hockey Stops}

This drill involves working on both forwards and backwards hockey stops.

If the skater is not comfortable with drop steps, they may be replaced with regular laterals.

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with both feet parallel and facing forwards.
\item Perform a drop-step into a lateral towards the right.
\item Perform a hockey stop, ending with feet parallel and facing the original direction.
\item Perform a drop-step into skating backwards towards the right.
\item Perform a backwards hockey stop, ending with feet parallel and facing the original direction. 
\item Repeat.
\end{itemize}

This should also be performed to the left.

{\it Progressions}
Replace the hockey stops with one foot hockey stops, only placing the other foot after coming to a complete stop.
Increase tempo and power.
