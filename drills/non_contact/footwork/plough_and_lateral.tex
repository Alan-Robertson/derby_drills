\section{Plough Stop Footwork Drills}
\label{sec:footwork/plough}

These are footwork drills involving plough stops.

\subsection*{Back and Forwards}
\label{sec:footwork/plough/back_forwards}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The skater starts at the inside line and accellerates forwards.
\item After 10 feet they should perform a plough stop.
\item Next they should perform a lateral to the middle of the track 
\item Next they should accellerate backwards 10 feet and perform a backwards plough stop. 
\item They should perform a lateral to the outside of the track
\item The skater should then accellerate forwards 10 feet and perform a plough stop. 
\item Next the skater should perform a lateral to the middle of the track
\item Mirroring their previous motion they should then skate backwards 10 feet and perform a backwards plough stop  
\item After a final lateral to the inside of the track the skater will be in the same position in which they started.  
\end{enumerate}

{\it Progressions}
A natural progression of this is to replace all of the plough stops with hockey stops, and all of the lateral movements with pull-unders. Backwards plough stops should be replaced with backwards hockey stops.
