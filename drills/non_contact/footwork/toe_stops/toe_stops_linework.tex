\subsection*{Drill: Toe Stop Linework}

This is a sequence of toe-stop movements along the inside or outside line.

The drill begins with the skater on track and facing towards the line.

\begin{itemize}
\item Jump transition, landing facing away from the line
\item Single grape vine step, single toe stop step out. 
\item Backwards toe stop spin, over the line ending facing the line.
\item Repeat.
\end{itemize}

It may also begin initially facing away from the line, with the same steps.

{\it Progression:}

The toe stop spin may be accentuated with a jump, landing on the opposite toe stop.
