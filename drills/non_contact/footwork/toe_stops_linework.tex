\subsection*{Drill: Toe Stop Linework}

This is a sequence of toe-stop movements along the inside or outside line.

The drill begins with the skater on track and facing towards the line.

\begin{itemize}
\item Jump transition, landing facing away from the line
\item Single grape vine step 
\item Toe stop spin, ending facing towards the line, may add a hop to the spin.
\end{itemize}

The drill can be repeated from here.
It may also begin facing away from the line, with the same steps.
