\subsection*{Drill: Circling Edgework}
\label{drill:footwork/circling_edgework}

This is an edgework drill involving heavy use of one foot weighted skating, in this case the front leg.


The skater should perform a single carve, then they should lift their back leg and reverse the motion using a side surf to turn in the opposite direction.
Following the side surf they should again lift their back leg and perform a carve in the same direction as the first.


This drill should be repeated on both sides, and may be repeated backwards.
