\subsection*{Russian Circles} 
\label{drill:footwork/russian_circles} 

Starting in the middle of two cones.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Carve in front of one cone
\item Perform a pivot transition, with hips remaining forwards facing.
\item Perform a drop step around the outside of the cone. 
\item Perform a stepped transition with hips remaining forwards facing, resetting position between the cones. 
\item Repeat in the other direction around the other cone.
\end{itemize}
The goal is to maintain momentum through each of the steps.


This can also be reversed.


\begin{itemize}
\item Carve around the back and outside of a cone. 
\item Perform a pivot transition, with hips remaining forwards facing.
\item Perform a drop step through the inside of the cones. 
\item Perform a stepped transition with hips remaining forwards facing, resetting position between the cones. 
\item Repeat in the other direction around the other cone.
\end{itemize}
