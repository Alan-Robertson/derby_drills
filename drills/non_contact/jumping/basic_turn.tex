This is easiest practiced on the inside of the approach into the apex, and is hardest on the outside of the apex.

Approach line, place opposite toe stop on line, swing around line with other foot while facing inwards. 
If required, the movement should stop prior to the placement.    


Progress with longer distances of swinging, and incorporate skating into the motion. 


Eventually add a toe stop shuffle into the mix.
