This section relates to a series of jumps that begin with a glide.

These jumps often involve pivot transitions, as described in \Cref{sec:transitions/pivot}.

\subsection{Development}
The skater begins by gliding on their foot closest centre of the track. 

The skater then performs a pivot transition on the front wheels of that foot, while kicking their other leg up into the air.  

This motion opens the hips, allowing the skater to turn the landing of the jump and making it appropriate for jumping on the straight.
