\subsection{Grapevine Jump}
{\it Chackram}
In either lane 1 or lane 4 approach the line in a side-surf with your back to the line.   

Place your back foot toestop behind your front leg in a grape vine position and spring off. 

Due to the turn from facing inwards this jump preferences the outside line.
