\section{Staggered}
\label{sec:jumping/staggered}

One of the first developmental skills for jumping is a staggered jump. 

While skating raise one leg.
Begin to place that leg back on the ground, and as you transfer weight lift the other leg in a small jump.

To avoid falling backwards, as the skater performs the jump they should shift their weight forwards. 
Additionally as the skater lands they should bend their legs into the landing to absorb the impact safely. 

As an important part of this drill, the goal is not to launch forwards, only up. 
The existing momentum of the skater from before they leave the ground will provide the necessary forwards motion.
