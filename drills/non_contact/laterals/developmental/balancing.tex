\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Lateral Balancing}
\label{drill:laterals/developmental_balancing}

The first issue that new skaters may encounter is that while they may be proficient in one footed glides with their legs parallel, they may not have practiced with their legs akimbo.     
As this utilises different sets of muscles this may require some initial practice.


Begin by standing and balancing on one foot facing forwards with the foot turned out 90 degrees.
The other leg should be raised but still facing forwards. 
The skater's hips should be turned towards the turned out foot. 
Practice this on both legs.
