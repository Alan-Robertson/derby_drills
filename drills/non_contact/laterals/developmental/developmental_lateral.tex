\subsection*{Basic Lateral}
\label{technique:laterals/developmental/basic}

Begin on the line with your feet in a `T' position. The capping bar of the T should run parallel to the line, while the other foot should be pointing away from the line.     

Skateboard push using the forwards facing foot, laterally skating on the other foot.   

The skater should glide on their front foot for some distance.
They may then plant their back foot, transferring weight, then lift and re-plant their front foot to stop the movement. 

While developing a third step may be added by re-lifting the back foot, but this should be replaced with the two-step movement over time.
