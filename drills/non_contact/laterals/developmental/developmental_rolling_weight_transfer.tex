\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Rolling Weight Transfer}
\label{drill:lateral/book/weight_transfer_rolling}

This drill revolves around transferring weight between feet while holding a lateral stance. 
This drill should begin by rolling forwards on one foot.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Starting with feet in the `T' position, hips facing forwards with one foot turned out and knees bent.
\item The skater should shift their weight over the turned out foot, a good metric is to get their centre of balance out over their knee. 
\item Next raise the forward facing foot. 
\item Then work on placing the forward facing foot back in the same position shifting weight from a central position to out over the knee and back.
\end{itemize}
