\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Static Weight Transfer}
\label{drill:lateral/book/weight_transfer_static}

We will begin by performing this motion while static.

\begin{itemize}
\item Starting with feet in the `T' position, hips facing forwards with one foot turned out and knees bent.
\item The skater should shift their weight over the turned out foot, a good metric is to get their centre of balance out over their knee. 
\item Next raise the forward facing foot. 
\item Then work on placing the forward facing foot back in the same position shifting weight from a central position to out over the knee and back.
\end{itemize}


%{\it Progression}
%As a hip flexor exercise, and as part of learning forward facing transitions the skater may instead   
%
%The speed of the next few motions depends on the hip flexibility of the skater. 
%With lower flexibility these should be performed in quick succession, conversely skaters that are more adept at side surfing might perform a side surf at this point.    
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Place the raised foot inline-with, but facing out and away from the planted foot. 
%\item Lift the first foot, keeping it perpendicular to the newly planted foot  and flip the hips towards the newly planted foot.
%\end{itemize}
