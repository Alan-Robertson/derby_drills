\subsection*{Developmental Drill: From T Stops}
\label{drill:laterals/developmental/t_stop}

This drill is focused on the hip motions required to perform a lateral.
In particular those needed for the glide and the stop.    


Begin with a T-stop drill - either around the track or in a jackie daniels style.

Once skaters are feeling comfortable with their T-stops they should be instructed to alter their posture.  

\begin{itemize}
\item While skating forwards on one foot, they should turn their upper torso to face perpendicular to the direction that their breaking foot (in the T stop) is pointing. 
\item They should hold this position for the glide.
\item While performing their T stop they should continue to hold that position.
\end{itemize}
