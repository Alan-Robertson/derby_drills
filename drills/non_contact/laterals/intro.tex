\chapter{Laterals}
\label{ch:laterals}

Laterals are a technique for travelling laterally across the track.  
For the purposes of this chapter we will consider three different components of the lateral: the starting push, the transfer between feet (if any), and the stopping technique.         

Some of these may be mixed and matched.
