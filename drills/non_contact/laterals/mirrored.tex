\subsection*{Drill: Mirrored Laterals}
\label{drill:laterals/mirrored}

Skaters work in pairs, approximately 5ft apart. 
One skater is leading, the other follows.
Skaters perform laterals across the track, with the `blocking' skater tracking and following.

This may be performed both with skaters facing each other, or the tracking skater facing away from the skater they are tracking. 



{\it Variation}
For a larger group.
Skaters should all face in the same direction around the track, each skater tracks the skater two in front of them.
Alternatively, if doing the backwards variant then they should track the skater two behind them.
