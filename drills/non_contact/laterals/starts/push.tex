\subsection*{Skateboard Push Lateral}

Begin on the line with your feet in a `T' position. The capping bar of the T should run parallel to the line, while the other foot should be pointing away from the line.     

Skateboard push using the forwards facing foot, laterally skating on the other foot.   

The skater should glide on their front foot for some distance.

This drill may then be integrated with any of the stopping drills.
