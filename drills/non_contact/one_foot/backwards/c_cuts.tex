\subsection*{Drill: Backwards $C$ Cuts}
\label{drill:one_foot/backwards/c_cut}

For a developmental version, begin with both feet on the ground and one foot out front and perpendicular.  
Drag the front foot around and back in a 180 degree arc, performing the $C$ cut. 

Once the motion is ready, remove the other foot from the ground. 



{\bf Progressions:}
Progressions include performing a backwards crossover between backwards $C$ cuts.
Start facing side on the track and perform a backwards crossover, moving in derby direction. 
Then perform a backwards $C$ cut flipping the facing of the skater.    
Next perform another backwards crossover, continuing the motion in derby direction.
