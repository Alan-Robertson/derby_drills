\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Backwards One Foot Skating}
\label{drill:one_foot/backwards/developmental}

When approaching backwards one foot skating, the same developmental drills as forwards are recommended.
They are abbreviated here as it is expected that forwards one foot skating will have been developed already. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Balancing and rocking
\item Backwards glides
\item Backwards circles
\item Backwards serpentine
\item Backwards self-propelled
\end{itemize}
