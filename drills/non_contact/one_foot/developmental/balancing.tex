\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Balancing}
\label{drill:one_foot/developmental/balancing}

The first and simplest predicate for one footed skating is standing on one foot. 

This may be practiced off skates for skaters who have not yet developed their proprioception.    

The skate should be planted and pressure applied evenly to maintain position.   
The skater should not be rolling either forwards or backwards.
