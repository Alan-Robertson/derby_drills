\subsection*{Developmental Drill: One Foot Glides} 
\label{drill:one_foot/developmental/glides}


Gain some momentum and glide on one foot around the track. 

If this is part of a developmental drill start at the jammer line and begin with a glide to the pivot line. 
You should aim to extend this through to the turn. 
At this stage some basic one footed edge work and leaning will be required to make it through the turn.   
Some reasonable benchmarks are: From a stationary start the skater should make it to either one quarter or halfway around the track. 

From a rolling start the skater should aim to make it around the track.
Eventually the goal should be to extend this to a glide around the track from a stationary start.
