\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Lifting}
\label{drill:one_foot/developmental/lifting}

A common issue that skaters often encounter is that when lifting their leg while skating that this action throws off their balance.
They will manage to keep their balance while their leg continues its initial swing, then arresting that motion will throw off their balance, ending their one footed sojourn.  


Starting stationary, lean out over one hip until one foot naturally leaves the ground.
This circumvents the issues with raising the foot with too much force and places the skater's weight in the correct position for one footed skating.    


Another approach to this is to emphasise lifting from the `hip' rather than from the thigh.
This may make the initial balance distribution slightly harder, but will also help with developing one foot form.
