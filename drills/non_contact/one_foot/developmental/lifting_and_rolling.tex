\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Lifting and Rolling}
\label{drill:one_foot/developmental/lifting_and_rolling}


Assume the same position as the lifting drill, this time while rolling with a small amount of momentum. 
While rolling, gently lift the extended leg, allowing the extention to `hitch' the hip.
Keep the grounded leg bent and ready to fall forwards to take that knee if difficulties arise.
