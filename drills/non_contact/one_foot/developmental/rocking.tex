\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Rocking}
\label{drill:one_foot/developmental/rocking}

Having established that the skater is able to lift into a one footed stance, and that they are able to balance while stationary, the next goal is to get a small amount of dynamic motion. 

From a starting position of balancing on one foot, rock backwards and forwards on that foot. 
The skater will need to adjust their ankle to compensate for the movement.
