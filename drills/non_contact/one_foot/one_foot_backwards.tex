\section{Backwards One Foot}
\label{sec:one_foot/backwards}



\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Rocking}
\label{drill:one_foot/backwards/rocking}
This is identical to the forwards one footed rocking drill. 

Having established that the skater is able to lift into a one footed stance, and that they are able to balance while stationary, the next goal is to get a small amount of dynamic motion. 

From a starting position of balancing on one foot, rock backwards and forwards on that foot. 
The skater will need to adjust their ankle to compensate for the movement.



\subsection*{Drill: Backwards $C$ Cuts}
\label{drill:one_foot/backwards/c_cut}

For a developmental version, begin with both feet on the ground and one foot out front and perpendicular.  
Drag the front foot around and back in a 180 degree arc, performing the $C$ cut. 

Once the motion is ready, remove the other foot from the ground. 



{\bf Progressions:}
Progressions include performing a backwards crossover between backwards $C$ cuts.
Start facing side on the track and perform a backwards crossover, moving in derby direction. 
Then perform a backwards $C$ cut flipping the facing of the skater.    
Next perform another backwards crossover, continuing the motion in derby direction.
