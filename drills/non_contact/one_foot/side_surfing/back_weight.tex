\subsection*{Backwards Weighted Side Surfing}
\label{drill:side_surf/back_weighted}

Side surfing can also be performed near identically with the weight in the back foot. 

The skater should begin skating forwards and lift and place their rear foot to enter into a side surf.
The skater may initially weight their front leg. 
The skater should then transfer their weight to their back leg while maintaining the side surf.
They should be able to demonstrate this by lifting their front leg as they skate.

This technique is useful for a number of loaded jumps.
