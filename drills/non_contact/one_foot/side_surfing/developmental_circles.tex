\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Circling}
\label{drill:side_surf/circle}

When developing side-surfing skaters may discover that they don't have the hip flexibility to reach the required angle for a proper side surf.   

Instead the skaters may opt for a smaller hip angle and instead work in small circles. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Take a stance with the hips open to a comfortable angle.
\item Pick a `forwards direction' and lock that leg in. 
\item Perform egg-shell movements with the back leg to generate momentum. 
\item Steer in a circle with the forwards leg.
\end{itemize}


If the skater is cleared for contact, it may be helpful to circle while hold hands with another more experienced skater when performing this drill.  
The other skater can provide the initial momentum which will help with developing proper form and hip angling.
