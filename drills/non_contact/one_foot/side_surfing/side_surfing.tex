\section{Side Surfing}
\label{sec:one_foot/side_surf}

Side surfing is a close relative of one footed skating - most of the skater's weight is distributed to a single foot.

The core technique is to load all the skater's weight into their front leg (leaning may help) while keeping the back leg on the ground in an open position.

{\it Common Pitfall:} If the skater is spinning as they attempt to perform a side-surf it is likely that they are trying to centre their weight.  
Moving their weight to the front leg should assist with this.
