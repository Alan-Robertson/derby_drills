\subsection*{Stroked Side Surfing}
\label{drill:side_surf/stroked}

Rather than holding the position, use the back leg to provide propulsion by lifting and performing a `stroke'.    

{\it Progressions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perform multiple strokes before resuming forwards skating.  
\item Alternate the facing of the side surf and stroke accordingly. 
\end{itemize}
