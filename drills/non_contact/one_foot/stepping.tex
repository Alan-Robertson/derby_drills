\section{Stepping}
While not technically skating on one foot, this is a developmental skill for weight transfer that help with one footed skating and techniques that depend on it. For example laterals, transitions etc.   


\subsection*{Technique}

Stepping technique varies between the direction of motion. 

The first concern is to have sufficient static balance when standing (i.e. not rolling) and lifting and placing skates.  



\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Stepping in Place} 
\label{drill:one_foot/stepping/in_place}
Without moving, this drill is simply about raising and placing skates back on the ground without rolling.


\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Stepping} 
\label{drill:one_foot/stepping/warm_up}

This is perhaps best concieved as an 80s aerobics class.

One skater leads the drill, the other skaters mirror the `instructor'.
The instructor indicates a direction of stepping, either forwards, backwards, left or right for the skaters to follow.


With more developed groups of skaters synchronisation of steps may be added to the drill. This is not reccomended for developing skaters who should be free to set their own pace and level of comfort.
