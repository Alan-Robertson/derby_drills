\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Stepping in Place} 
\label{drill:one_foot/stepping/in_place}
Without moving, this drill is simply about raising and placing skates back on the ground without rolling.


{\it Common Pitfalls}
Skaters may raise their hips when lifting their leg, unweighting their loaded leg and rolling. This is particularly prevalent on the forwards and backwards steps. 
One approach to ameliorating this is encouraging them to swing their leg from their hip rather than lifting it when placing their foot either forwards or backwards.
