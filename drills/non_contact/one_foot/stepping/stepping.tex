\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Stepping} 
\label{drill:one_foot/stepping/warm_up}

This is perhaps best concieved as an 80s aerobics class.

One skater leads the drill, the other skaters mirror the `instructor'.
The instructor indicates a direction of stepping, either forwards, backwards, left or right for the skaters to follow.


With more developed groups of skaters synchronisation of steps may be added to the drill. This is not reccomended for developing skaters who should be free to set their own pace and level of comfort.
