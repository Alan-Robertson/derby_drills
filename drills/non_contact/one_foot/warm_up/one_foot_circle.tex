\subsection*{Drill One Foot Circles}
\label{drill:one_foot/circles}
A set of four movements (eight counting backwards) for developing edgework. 


The skater should find an open space on the track, and attempt to hold an edge on one foot, either inside or outside to start curving their skating.   
No active movement of the foot should be required to achieve this - if the skater is lifting or adjusting their wheels then they're forcing the turn rather than using their edges.
