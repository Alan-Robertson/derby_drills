\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: One Foot Self Propelled} 

As with one foot weaving, but now additional motion should be generated on the turns to maintain momentum.

Further development is to not use the extra leg as ballast to help generate momentum, but to only use the leg that is in contact with the ground.
