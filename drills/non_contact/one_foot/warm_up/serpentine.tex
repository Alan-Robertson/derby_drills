\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Serpentine} 

As different extension to one footed weaves.

Rather than two lanes of the track at a sharper angle than 45 degrees glide from line to line on one foot. At the line, or as close to it as the skater feels comfortable use the edges of the skate to turn, as in a weave or a carve to face the other line and continue the motion.   

As we're not currently generating momentum from this motion after two or three turns change feet. 
The focus is on the sharpness of the turn, rather than the speed. 
Speed may be added after technique has been polished.
