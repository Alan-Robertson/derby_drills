\subsection*{Developmental Drill: On the Spot}
\label{drill:sticky/backwards/spot}

This drill is about getting comfortable enough with the edges of the skates to perform the motions required for an eggshell.   

It also assists in shifting weight from the front to the back of the skate. 

Starting from a stopped position, the skater should attempt to perform one eggshell motion forwards, then the same motion backwards, ending up in their starting position.
