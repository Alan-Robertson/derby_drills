\section*{Backwards Sticky Skating}
\label{sec:sticky/backwards}

The basic skills here are similar to those in \Cref{sec:sticky/eggshells} except now we are going backwards. 

This necessitates a few minor changes.
The first being that our weight has moved from just in front of the back truck, to just behind the front truck of the skate. 
Instead of steering with the front of the skate, we now steer with the back.

Additionally, as going backwards involves the skater not seeing the direction in which they are skating, it is strongly advised to look over one shoulder - typically towards the inside of the track.     

The drills here are near identical to the front facing eggshells.
