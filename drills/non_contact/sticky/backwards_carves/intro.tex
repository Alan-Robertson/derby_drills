\section{Backwards Carving}

\label{sec:sticky/backwards_carves}

The backwards version of a carve.

As with the forwards version of the carve, weight may be distributed over either the forwards or backwards leg. With that said, typically the backwards leg is easier.  

Starting by skating backwards in a split stance the skater draws their inside leg (relative to the track) through the turn first, following with their outside leg.   
The legs should leave the turn co-linearly. 


{\it: Common Pitfalls}
Skaters that are weighting up their back leg may neglect their front edges. If this is happening then their front foot will fail to follow their back, leaving their back leg over-extended behind them.   


Skaters that are not drawing their back leg behind their front leg may find themselves falling over.
