\subsection*{Turn-About Carves}

A variant on the warm up drill.

Rather than carving inwards, instead take the larger outwards carve, looping back in to the center of the track. 

The path taken along the track can be seen in \Cref{fig:sticky/carves/turn_about}, in this instance the skater will be moving along this path backwards.
