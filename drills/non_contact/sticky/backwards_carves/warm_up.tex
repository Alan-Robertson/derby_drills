\subsection*{Warm Up Drill:}
A common warm-up drill is to backwards carve within lanes or from line to line in derby direction, alternating leading leg with each turn.    

Emphasis should be on the maintaining form and the sharpness of the turn. For the purposes of technique sharper angled carves should be focused on over forwards speed. 


{\bf Progressions:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Progressing with carving is a matter of increasing lateral speed and taking sharper angles without hockey stopping. 
    \item  Another progression is to move enough weight to the edges that only two wheels on each skate make contact with the ground.
    \item Foregoing some of the purpose of the drill, with enough speed the carves can be replaced with partial hockey stops. Rather than coming to a complete stop the goal should be to burn off speed until the stop can be skated out of in a carve.    
\end{itemize}
