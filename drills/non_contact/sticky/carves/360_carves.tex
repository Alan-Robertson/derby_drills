\subsection*{Drill: 360 Carves}
\label{drill:sticky/carves/360}

An extension of the turn about carves.

A variant on the warm up drill.

Rather than carving inwards, instead take the larger outwards carve, looping back in to the center of the track. 
The skater should complete a full 360 degree turn, then move towards the opposite line.



The path taken along the track can be seen in \Cref{fig:sticky/carves/turn_about}.
