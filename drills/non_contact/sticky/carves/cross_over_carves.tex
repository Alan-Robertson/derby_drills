\subsection*{Cross-over Carves}

A variant on the previous drill. 
While carving line to line skaters should perform a crossover in between each carve in the direction of motion.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Carve on the outside line
    \item Crossover towards the inside line 
    \item Carve on the inside line
    \item Crossover towards the outside line
    \item Repeat 
\end{itemize}

This will increase the lateral speed with which the skater enters the carve, and by extension puts more pressure on the edge-work required.      

This is a useful drill for developing up to hockey stops.
