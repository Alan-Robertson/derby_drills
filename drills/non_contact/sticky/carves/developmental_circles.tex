\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Circles}

This drill is designed to focus on the edgework technique of a carve without the added complexities of pulling the other leg through.

Rather than ending the carve the skater should attempt to simply keep carving in a circle until they run out of momentum. 
Newer skaters may attempt overly eager turning circles.  
They should be encouraged to instead take larger circles with better technique.
