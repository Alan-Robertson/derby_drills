\subsection*{Variant: Fast Eggshells}
\label{sec:sticky/eggshells/fast}

In this we avoid pushing the eggshell fully out or in, instead the skate oscillates on the inside and outside of the knee.  
Weight should be distributed more towards the back truck such that the front is unweighted for faster steering.
