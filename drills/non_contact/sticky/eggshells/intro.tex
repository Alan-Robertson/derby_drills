\section*{Eggshells}
\label{sec:sticky/eggshells}

Also called `melons', `bubbles', `lemons' and likely a small plethora of other names. 


\subsection*{Technique}

Eggshell technique is focused around stance and weight distribution.
To move in a forwards direction weight should be centered two-thirds back in the skater's foot, typically towards the front of the heel, or right in front of the back axle of the skate.  
This leaves the front wheels relatively unweighted to `steer' the skate through the turns as required. 
This will vary slightly from skater to skater, and will be adjusted depending on the position of their upper body. 

The skater's skates should move outwards from their body via application of weight to their outside edges, then move back inwards via application of weight to their inside edges.
The movement can be seen in \Cref{fig:sticky/eggshells}.

The skater should be using just their lower body to perform this motion.
By bending their legs they can offset the extension of their legs with the outwards push and maintain a constant height without ``bobbing" up and down. 

{\bf Common Pitfalls: }
If the skater is bobbing up and down as they perform eggshells then they are not bending their knees enough. 

If the skater is lifting or correcting foot position then they are not applying their weight to the edges of their skates.  


If the skater is juttering backwards and forwards as they attempt to perform the eggshell, then their weight distribution is in the centre of their skate, not shifted back towards the heel.
