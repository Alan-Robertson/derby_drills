\subsection*{Variant: Wide Eggshells}
\label{drill:sticky/eggshells/wide}

As with the regular eggshell, except this time the skater should attempt to take a wider trajectory.    

As this will involve a greater leg extension, and we are still trying to avoid bobbing up and down, this will require a lower initial stance.
