\chapter{Sticky Skating}
\label{ch:sticky}


Sticky skating is a basic skating skill.
Unlike `duck-walking', sticky skating focuses on maintaining contact with the ground while generating speed and maintaining control.  


The advantage of this over duck walking is that it requires less balance as the skater does not have to skate with only one foot in contact with the ground.    
This also provides a solid basis to work on training the various muscles and reactions that are required to skate, without the added distractions associated with balancing.
