\subsection*{Front-Back Balancing}
\label{drill:manual/front_back}

The easiest manual to perform is to take a split stance and balance on the front wheels of the back foot, and the back wheels of the front foot. 

{\bf Progressions:}
The tighter the split stance the more difficult the balancing act.
Bringing legs closer together will increase the difficulty of the activity.
