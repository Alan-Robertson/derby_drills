\section{Manuals}
\label{sec:sticky/manuals}

Manuals are a dance-skating technique involving skating or balancing on two wheels on each skate.   
Typically these are either the front or back two wheels, but they may also be the side wheels.

Manuals are not technically a necessary derby skill, but are required for some variant skills (such as pivot transitions in \Cref{sec:transitions/pivot}).
