\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Manual Pull}
\label{drill:manual/pull}

This drill improves egg shells as well as generates force using fewer than four wheels on the ground.  

Adopt a split stance. 
Leave all four wheels of the back leg on the ground.  
On the front leg use either a heel or a toe manual.  

Perform eggshells using just the front or back two wheels of the front skate.
