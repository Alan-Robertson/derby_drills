\section*{Reversed Carves}
\label{sec:sticky/reverse_carves}

Typically the stance of a carve leans such that the direction of turning, the skates and the edges are all aligned.    
Here we will generalise these assumptions. 
The goal of this drill is to work on reversing the usual edge-work, without changing stance.


Using the same split stance as a carve, manipulate your edges to turn in the opposite direction. 


Highly oblique angles are fine for this, unlike a regular carve where the drop and turn affords the skater the ability to gain additional momentum, for this technique the turn comes from edgework and the movement of the front foot generated from the hips.
