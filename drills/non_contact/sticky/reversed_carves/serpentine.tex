\subsection*{Serpentine Reversed Carves}
\label{drill:sticky/reverse_carves/serpentine}

Begin skating forwards in a split stance.

Start a carve towards either the out or inside line, then without changing stance turn the carve towards the opposite line. 

Regain momentum and repeat.

Using cones or 10 foot markers on the track is useful for this motion, try to carve and reverse carve around alternative markers.
Repeat for both sides.
