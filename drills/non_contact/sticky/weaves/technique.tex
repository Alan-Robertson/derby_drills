\subsection*{Technique}

Weaving involves forwards motion on skates while the skates remain approximately parallel.   

A simple version is to syncopate the motions of a basic eggshell.  
One leg is pushing out while the other is dragging in, then the legs swap roles. 

Emphasis should be on the form of the skater's hips, shoulders, ankles and knees. 
In particular the skater's shoulders should maintain an even height, while their hips, knees and ankles should oscillate laterally with hips and ankles aligned and knees out of alignment.    
Hips should turn sharply with each weave, and should feel like the skater is `throwing' their hips. 


Speed is generated through the egg-shell-like cuts performed by each leg, and by the skater dropping their weight with each turn.
