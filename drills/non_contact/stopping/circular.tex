\subsection*{Drill: Circular Stopping}
\label{drill:stopping/circular}

This is a similar generic stopping drill.  
Unlike Jackie Daniels which allows skaters to work at their own pace, this variant begins to add some notion of pace.


Skaters space themselves in pairs in 20ft increments around the track. 
On a whistle one skater in each pair is to accelerate and stop at the next 20ft marker. 
On the subsequent whistle the other member of the pair is to do the same. 

Whistle timing may be varied, at the start of the drill skaters may be allotted 5 seconds per stop, towards the end this can be brought down to 3 seconds.
