\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Carving In} 

The first and most straightforwards approach to learning hockey stops.
Begin with a carve, and apply more force to the edges closest to the skater's body such that you come to a stop during the movement.   

The focus should be on the sharpness of the carve at low speeds, while applying force on the frontward facing outside edges on both skates, and leaning backwards into the stop. 

Ideally the skater should end with their feet parallel.

{\bf Common Pitfall:} Skaters may fail to bring their back leg through the carve and end up in a power-slide instead of a hockey stop.
