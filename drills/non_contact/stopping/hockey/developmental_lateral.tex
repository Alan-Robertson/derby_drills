\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Lateral Approach} 
% Roman Vitriol

Another approach to learning hockey stops is to begin with a lateral movement rather than a forwards one.    
The advantage of this is that there is less distance to turn, the hip movement is already incorporated, and having a set line to stop on may assist conceptually.   


Starting with a lateral, perform a C cut to stop.
