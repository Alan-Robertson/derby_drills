This is similar to the lateral hockey stops. 
Rolling at a low speed in a forwards direction the skater should attempt to shift their weight to their front wheels and push out with their rear wheels, turning to enter a stopping position. 

While moving to this position they should begin to engage the stop.
The skater's weight should shift to the edges of their skates closest to their body, with weight loaded mostly on the leg closest to their body.
