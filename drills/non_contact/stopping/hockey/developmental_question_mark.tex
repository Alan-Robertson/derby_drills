\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Question Marks} 

A developmental drill that helps with skaters that have the initial movement down, but have not yet got the stopping portion of the hockey stop nailed down.      

Place two cones 10ft apart. 
Starting from the rear cone, skate forwards and carve around the front of the front cone.       
If the skater stopped then they've managed to do a hockey stop, if they did not stop continue the carve through and around till the skater is facing the rear cone. 
Repeat the motion, increasing speed to help get a better edge for stopping.
