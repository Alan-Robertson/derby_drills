\chapter{Stopping}
\label{ch:stopping}


Most warm up stopping drills are agnostic to the style of stop being used. 
As a result we provide those drills here, they may be applied to any of the stops in this section.  


Developing Skaters should consider the stops in\Cref{sec:stopping/plough,sec:stopping/t_stops}.
