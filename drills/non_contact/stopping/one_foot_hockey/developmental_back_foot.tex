\subsection{Developmental: Back Foot Hockey Stops}

One foot hockey stops are best approached via the `question-mark' method.

Start with single foot circles, working turning `inwards' over the other leg.

Once skaters are comfortable with this movement, their next goal is to burn off all speed during this turn.
This will involve varying the pressure on the edge as they turn, blurring the distinction between their turn and a one-footed plough stop.
Throughout all these progressions it is essential that the skater holds their balance after coming to a stop - toppling or placing their other foot down will teach poor habits and form.
