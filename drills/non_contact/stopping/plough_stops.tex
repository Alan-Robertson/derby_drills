\section{Plough Stops}
\label{sec:stopping/plough}

Plough stop technique varies with skating ability and edgework.  
Often what is good technique to learn and develop plough stops is poor technique later on.  

For this reason we will strictly split developmental plough stop technique from derby utility plough stop techniques. 


\subsection{Developing Plough Stops}





\subsection{Developmental Drill: Rocking}
\label{drill:stopping/plough/rocking}

One method of attempting to develop the required motion for plough stops is to   

Rock back and forwards on the spot using eggshells. The idea is that the forwards momentum of a single outwards push of an eggshell from a standing position is very small, and can be arrested very quickly by the second motion of the eggshell.  


\subsection{Developmental Drill: Cruising} 
\label{drill:stopping/plough/cruising}


The focus of this drill is not to engage the edges for a sharp stop, but instead to work on leg position and holding form for the stop.  

Begin by performing a series of eggshells to build some speed. 
The skater should then hold the position of their final eggshell just after they have begun to bring their legs in.   
Feet should be tilted in only slightly, if the angle is too sharp a developing skater is liable to topple.
