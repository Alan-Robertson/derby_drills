\subsection{Developmental Drill: Cruising} 
\label{drill:plough_stops/cruising}


The focus of this drill is not to engage the edges for a sharp stop, but instead to work on leg position and holding form for the stop.  

Begin by performing a series of eggshells to build some speed. 
The skater should then hold the position of their final eggshell just after they have begun to bring their legs in.   
Feet should be tilted in only slightly, if the angle is too sharp a developing skater is liable to topple.
