\subsection{Developmental Drill: Non-passive Ploughs}
\label{sec:stopping/plough_one_foot/cuts}

In this drill we begin to replace the `eggshell' model of plough stops with a C cut model. 

While at rest start with both feet parallel. 

Move one foot forwards with weight distributed to the inside front wheel, while pushing out with both back wheels.  
This forms the basis of a plough stop.
