\subsection{Developmental Drill: Rocking}
\label{drill:stopping/plough/rocking}

One method of attempting to develop the required motion for plough stops is to practice moving back and forwards on the spot. 
The idea here being that the `stopping motion on the spot is near identical to the stopping motion of the plough stop, just in a more confined area.

Rock back and forwards on the spot using eggshells. The idea is that the forwards momentum of a single outwards push of an eggshell from a standing position is very small, and can be arrested very quickly by the second motion of the eggshell.
