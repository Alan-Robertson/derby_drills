\subsection{Developmental Drill: Rocking}
\label{drill:stopping/plough/rocking}

One method of attempting to develop the required motion for plough stops is to   

Rock back and forwards on the spot using eggshells. The idea is that the forwards momentum of a single outwards push of an eggshell from a standing position is very small, and can be arrested very quickly by the second motion of the eggshell.
