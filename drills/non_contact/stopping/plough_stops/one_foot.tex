\section{One Footed Plough Stops}
\label{sec:stopping/plough_one_foot}

Application depends on the floor.

Developing skaters should lock in one leg and plough with the other. 
Weight should be distributed onto the front inside wheel, while the back wheels are free to pivot, controlling the stop. 

Progression is to moving the stopping leg forward and only turning the ankle rather than any sweeping motions.

{\it Progressions:}
The goal is to make the one footed plough as tight as possible.
To achieve this the foot should be slipped forwards before turning rather than taking an arc.
