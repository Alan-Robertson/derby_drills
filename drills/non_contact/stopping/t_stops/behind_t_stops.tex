\subsection*{Behind T stops}
\label{sec:stopping/t_stops/behind}

Traditionally the easiest form of T stop, though this may vary from skater to skater.

The skater begins skating forwards before transferring weight to one foot and lifting the other.

This foot is then placed behind and slightly offset out from the forward leg, tilted such that the back, outside edge of the skate makes contact with the ground first.

The stop is controlled by varying the pressure placed on this edge.


This stop can be used with regular stopping drills.
