\subsection*{Side T stops}
\label{drill:t_stop:side}


A T stop where instead of placing the foot behind, it is now placed out to the side of the skater.

The back edge of the skate should still be engaged first, and pressure is controlled in the same fashion.

Unlike the regular stop where stopping power can be generated by squeezing legs together, this stop places greater pressure on the hip flexors.
