\subsection*{Squeeze T Stops}
\label{drill:t_stop:squeeze}

A horizontally squeezed T stop. 
This is useful when jam reffing.


Skating into the apex, perform a T stop by squeeezing the inside leg towards your outside leg.  
The lopsidedness of this stop causes the skater to turn.

This uses the same edges and movement of a `T' stop despite the skaters feet being parallel.
