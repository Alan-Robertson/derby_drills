\section{Turn Around Toe Stops}
\label{sec:stopping/turn_around}

Turn around toe stops is a sharp stop that requires that a skater can perform a transition while rolling. 
Developing skaters should see \Cref{sec:transitions} before attempting this stop. 


This stop can be performed with any style of transition. 



\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Transition Variants}

When performing turn around toe stops as a regular Jackie Daniel's warm up (see \Cref{drill:stopping/jackie_daniels}), skaters should attempt to perform a different transition for each pair of turn around toe stops.
The pairing of the stops is so that skaters may perform the transition on each side.
