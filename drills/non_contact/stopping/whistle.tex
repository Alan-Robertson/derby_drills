\subsection*{Drill: Stopping on the Whistle}
One downside to the previous two stopping drills is that the skater expects the stop. 

The goal of this drill is to train performing stops without prior conceptual preparation.   

The trainer declares a style of stop, and then blows the whistle at random increments.  
Skaters skate around the track in derby direction.
When the whistle is blown, that style of stop should be performed.

One variant of this is to assign different stops to different whistles (single, double etc).
