\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Balances}
\label{drill:toe_stop/development/balances}

While stationary, the skater should start on skates adopt a staggered stance, and pop up onto their toe stops. 

{\it Progressions:}
One foot balances.
Skaters should already be comfortable balancing on one foot before they attempt this.
The main complexity here is the loss of the staggered stance, skaters should be low with knees bent while balancing.
