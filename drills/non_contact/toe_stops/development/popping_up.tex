\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Popping Up}
\label{drill:toe_stop/development/popping_up}
The skater begins by skating backwards.
They should then stagger their stance and lean onto their toe stops, coming to a stop. 

After this, they should resume skating backwards and repeat.


{\it Progressions:}
The first progression of this skill is for the sktater to not come to a stop, but instead burn off speed, then drop back down onto their wheels and continue skating.


Another progression is to do this on one foot, skate backwards, lift a foot, drop onto the toe stop either to stop or slow. 
If slowing on one foot the skater should be encouraged to drop back to that one foot rather than two feet immediately.
