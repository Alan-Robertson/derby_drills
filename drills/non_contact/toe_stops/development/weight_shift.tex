\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Weight shifting}
\label{drill:toe_stop/development/weight_shift}
The skater should begin stationary in a flat stance with skates facing slightly inwards.
Start by popping up onto toe stops from this non-staggered stance.

Next shift weight to one side and lift the other foot, then place that foot, shift weight and lift the first foot. 
When placing feet it is essential that the placement is of the toe-stop first, then the front two wheels, otherwise a developing skater is liable to lose their balance when trying to support themselves with just the front two wheels.


{\it Progressions:}
Eliminate the placement step so that it becomes a hop from toe-stop to toe-stop.  

Increase the distance between the legs that weight is being shifted over. 
Increase the pace of the shift.
With high enough pace and far enough distance this is no longer a developmental drill, but juking practice.
