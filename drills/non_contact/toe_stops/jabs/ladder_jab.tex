\subsection*{Drill: Ladder Jabs}

This is a collection of drills using a `ladder' or similar regular structure for practicing lateral jabbing moves.

The ladder need only be some markers on the ground.


{\it Simple Jab}

The skater should start on one side of the line,  jabbing their toe stop across the line as if about to make a step, before retracting to their original position.



{\it Move and Jab}
Perform a lateral leap across the line, followed by a simple jab back to the original side. Repeat moving forwards up the ladder.

The lateral leap may be either a side shuffle or a grape vine.
