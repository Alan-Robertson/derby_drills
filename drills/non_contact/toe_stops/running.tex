\section{Running}
\label{sec:toe_stop/running}

Toe stop running is a useful skill for gaining speed from a stopped position. 

Starting from a stopped position, pop up onto toe stops and lean forwards.    
The goal is to match the angle of the toe stop to the speed of the skater.
When the skater feels comfortable they may drop down from their toe stops and continue skating.


\subsection*{Developmental Drill: Building Up}
\label{drill:toe_stop/running/development} 

Pick three 10ft markers on the track.

The first is the start line, the second is as far down the track as the skater is comfortable running (start at the 10ft), the third is a stopping line.    


The skater begins at rest at the start line, on toe stops.  
The skater should launch from toe stops and run as far as they feel able, ideally till the second line.  
The skater should perform a turn-around toe-stop at the third line, and run out of it back to the first line. 

When developing this skill start with one to two steps, and build up from there.
