\section{Walking}
\label{sec:toe_stop/walking}

Toe stop walking is an elementary skill more about developing familiarity with toe-stops rather than being of direct utility in a game.    


Walking sideways is easier than backwards or forwards. 

Similar to the weight shifting drills in \Cref{\label{drill:toe_stop/weight_shift}} begin with feet in line but slightly pointed inwards and pop onto to stops.
Pick a direction, shift weight and move the un-weighted leg closer to the weighted leg, while maintaining the toe-stop pointing inwards.
When placing the foot it is imperative that the toe-stop is placed before the wheels.
Shift weight, and then move the now un-weighted leg away from the weighted leg. 
This should be done while maintaining the inwards pointing feet. 



Backwards is next and easier than forwards.
This is because skaters are required to place their toe-stops before their wheels.  
As with the side-ways steps, but instead of moving legs towards and away from each other, we now move them forwards one at a time.
