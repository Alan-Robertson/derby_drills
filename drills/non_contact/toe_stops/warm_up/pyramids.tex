\subsection*{Warm Up Drill: Toe Stop Pyramids}
\label{drill:toe_stops/warm_up/pyramids}
A toe stop cardio drill with jammer skills.

Starting in lane 1:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a toe stop side shuffle to lane 2, then back to 1 
\item Repeat for lane 3 back to lane 1, then lane 4 back to lane 2
\item From lane 2 repeat the first two steps until the skater starts in lane 4. 
\item Repeat the drill in the opposite direction starting from lane 4 to lane 1 
\end{enumerate}

Perform this drill first on the pivot line, then the jammer line, then the apex.


From the paucity of the above description, the sequence is: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lane 1 to lane 2 to lane 1 
\item Lane 1 to lane 3 to lane 1 
\item Lane 1 to lane 4 to lane 2 
\item Lane 2 to lane 3 to lane 2 
\item Lane 2 to lane 4 to lane 3 
\item Lane 3 to lane 4 
\item Lane 4 to lane 3 to lane 4 
\item Lane 4 to lane 2 to lane 4 
\item Lane 4 to lane 1 to lane 3 
\item Lane 3 to lane 2 to lane 3 
\item Lane 3 to lane 1 to lane 2 
\item Lane 2 to lane 1 
\end{enumerate}
