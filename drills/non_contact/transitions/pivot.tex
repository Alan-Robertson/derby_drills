\section{Pivot Transitions}
\label{sec:transitions/pivot}

Some practice with manuals will assist with this technique.
Manuals drills may be found in \ref{sec:sticky/manuals}.


The goal of a pivot transition is to flip position using only the front or back two wheels on each skate.  
It should be performed quickly.
