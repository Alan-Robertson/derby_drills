\section{Staggered Transitions}
\label{drill:transitions/staggered}

The staggered transition is similar to the turn out, but rather than starting with feet parallel we begin with them staggered.  
This stance begins with the skater's hips already open, which removes that portion of the manoeuvre from the turn out transition.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Adopt a staggered stance, turning over the back leg
\item Turn shoulders sideways in the direction of the turn  
\item Transfer weight to the front leg "shoulder over knee".
\item Lift the back leg, ideally the skater should be able to hold this position.
\item Place the back leg with facing more than 90 degrees from the front leg. The placement should not be twisted behind the placed leg but out to the side. 
\item Transfer weight to the back leg.
\item Lift the front leg 
\item Turn shoulders so that the skater is now facing backwards, bringing the front leg around. 
\item Place the front leg. 
\end{itemize}
