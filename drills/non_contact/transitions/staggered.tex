\section{Staggered Transitions}
\label{sec:transitions/staggered}


The staggered transition is similar to the turn out, but rather than starting with feet parallel we begin with them staggered.  
This stance begins with the skater's hips already open, which removes that portion of the manoeuvre from the turn out transition.  

\subsection*{Developmental Drill: On the Spot} 

With or without skates, adopt a split stance. 
The skater should flip their back leg, then their front leg to face in the opposite direction.
