Basic Weaving




Emphasis should be on the form of the skater's hips, shoulders, ankles and knees.   
In particular the skater's shoulders should maintain an even height, while their hips, knees and ankles should oscillate laterally with hips and ankles aligned and knees out of alignment.    


Progressions:

Progressing weaving involves increasing speed while maintaining form.   
Speed is generated by increased force through the edges.  

Another approach is to encourage skaters to weave using only two wheels on each skate.
