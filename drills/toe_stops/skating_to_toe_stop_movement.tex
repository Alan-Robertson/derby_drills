\section{Skating to Toe Stops and Back}
\label{sec:toe_stop/skating_to_toe}
% Pi

For reasons of difficulty, it is easier to start this backwards. 


\subsection{Skating Backwards}
Skate backwards, hop onto toe stops for a couple of steps, resume skating backwards.


This is easier than the forwards version as the toe stops are already angled backwards. 


\subsection{Skating Forwards}
As before, skate, toe stop, skate


\subsection{Sideways}

Side surving, toe stop lateral movement, side surf
