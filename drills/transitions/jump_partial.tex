\section{Partial Jump}
\label{sec:transitions/jump_partial}


If the regular in place transitions are constrained by hip movements, adding a small jump can assist in the motion.   


\begin{itemize}
    \item Turn head to the direction that you wish to be facing
    \item Open up the back leg, keeping it above the ground
    \item Flick shoulders to follow the head  
    \item Jump, turning hips to complete the turn and land on your back leg. This should leave you with your forwards leg in the air  
    \item Bring the forwards leg around to complete the transition  
\end{itemize}
