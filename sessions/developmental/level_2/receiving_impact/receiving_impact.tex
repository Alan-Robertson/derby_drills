\title{Receiving Impact}

\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent 

This session is a developmental session focused on delivering and receiving impacts in a safe manner (i.e. derby stance).
An additional focus is on improving basic derby skills such as laterals and transitions. 
The session is targeted more for the development of newer skaters, with progressions for more experienced skaters.        


As braced two walls and three walls provide additional stability that is often a crutch for newer skaters, these drills focus on removing this support.

\section*{Warm-up}
\label{sec:warmup}

\subsection*{Sticky Skating [Variant]}
\label{drill:sticky:sticky_one_foot}

Developing skaters may be compensating for not fully developed edge-work in sticky skating. Breaking down the motions and forcing each to pull their own weight should show this up quite quickly.  
Repeat the following skating forwards and backwards. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1$\times$ lap right leg pushing out, left leg stationary  
    \item 1$\times$ lap left leg pushing out, right leg stationary 
    \item 1$\times$ lap right leg pulling in, left leg stationary 
    \item 1$\times$ lap right leg pulling in, right leg stationary 
\end{itemize}

To put the motions back together:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2$\times$ laps regular sticky skating. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Carves and Weaves}
\label{drill:sticky:carves_and_weaves}
Weaving should focus on sharp hip movements, keeping feet close together and sharpness of edges. More experienced skaters are encouraged to try to maintain an edge on the inside two wheels of each skate.     
Carving should focus on the sharpness of the carve.
For more experienced skaters line to line carves should aim to incorporate a secondary motion to maintain momentum. For backwards carves this would ideally be a pull under.    

As before this should be repeated skating forwards and backwards
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 1 lane 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 2 lanes
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving, 2 lanes 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving, line to line
\end{itemize}



\section*{Stopping Drill}
\label{drill:stopping:jackie_daniels}
Basic Jackie Daniel's drill.

More experienced skaters should focus on decreasing stopping distance, then on increasing speed

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops - More experienced skaters should focus on one footed plough stops, emphasis should be on form, then stopping distance, then speed 
    \item T stops (may be excised for time constraints) - experienced skaters should focus on T stop variants (out to the side, and out in front)  
    \item Turn around toe stops - More experienced skaters should focus on varying their transitions (tight, opening and closing hips, serial jump, two foot jump, one foot transitions)    
    \item Power-slides - Less experienced skaters may substitute with plough stops
    \item Hockey stops - Less experienced skaters may substitute with plough stops
\end{itemize}

\section*{Flat Two Walls}

\input{../../../../drills/contact/three_wall/developmental/no_hands}



\section*{Two Wall Laterals}
\label{drill:two_wall:laterals}

Flat two walls, line to line laterals.  
More experienced skaters should use toe stop starts and push their fellow blockers.  

\section*{Two Wall Tracking}
\label{drill:two_wall:tracking}
In groups of three. 
Two blockers, one jammer.
Jammer works on moving between lanes 1 and 4, while the two wall works on catching and holding on the lines.
Emphasis on holding and not hitting out.      
Two walls should be flat.

Progression is to include jammer suck-backs.

\section*{Two Wall Driving}
\label{drill:two_wall:driving}
In groups of three. 
Two blockers, one jammer.
Jammer works on moving between lanes 1 and 4, while the two wall tries to drive the jammer.  
Focus should be on holding the jammer using the ribs and driving to the line, but not hitting out. 
Two walls should be flat.
As a progression the jammer should challenge the drive, and occasionally disengage for a suck back.

If training a dedicated Jammer, then keep the jammer in position, else rotate.
Blockers should rotate between inside and outside.
