\noindent 

This is mostly a revision session to warm up to level 2 after the end of level 1.

\section*{Overview}

{\bf Training Preamble}
This is the first level 2 session. The goal is mostly a warm up and return to skating, with a secondary goal of spending some time working on the more difficult level 1 skills.

\subsection*{Extended Warm-Up - 30 Mins}

Initial warm-up, break regularly for water and instructions as required.
All these skills should ideally be revision which we will attempt to normalise throughout the programme.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sticky skating - Regular, large and figure 8 eggshells
    \item Weaves - 1 lane, 2 lanes
    \item Carves - half track, line to line
    \item 3 Warm Laps
    \item One foot glides - aim for at least along the straight 
    \item 2 Medium-hot laps
    \item Backwards sticky skating - only regular eggshells here for this week 
    \item 1 Fast lap
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revision - 10 mins}
10 minutes picking up on weaker skills during the warm up.
This is likely to be weaving and carving.

\subsection*{Falls - 5 Mins}
This is a good time to revisit falling.

Run as a two sides of the track drill - one side with one fall, the other with the other.
Don't run this drill for too long, especially if skaters have poor kneepads.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[drill:falls/knee_taps]{Knee taps} and \hyperref[drill:falls/double_knee]{Double knee taps}
    \item \hyperref[drill:fall/turtle]{Turtle falls} and \hyperref[drill:falls/slide]{Slide falls}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Stops - 10 mins}

Some basic jackie daniels stopping drills.
Mostly just warming up after the break.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops, one foot if applicable. 
    \item T Stops
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Balancing Stepping and Walking - 10 mins}
Getting ankles engaged.

\begin{itemize}
    \item One foot balancing
    \item One foot balancing, leg turned out
    \item Stepping
    \item Toe stop balancing 
    \item Toe stop weight transfer
    \item Toe stop walking  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Backwards Skating - 10 Mins}
A few laps of backwards skating, either sticky or backwards duck walk.
The goal here is to stretch out the legs after stepping and walking and as a preamble to transitions. 

\subsection*{One Foot Skating - 15 Mins}

Looking at either gliding or starting to integrate edge-work, depending on where the skater's development is at.

The first goal should be for skaters to complete at least three quarters of a lap on a single glide - ideally they should be able to reach the full lap. 
Attention should be paid to balance as their momenum tails off.

For skaters who can comfortably perform this glide the focus can either be on \hyperref[drill:one_foot/circles]{single foot circles} or \hyperref[drill:one_foot/serpentine]{serpentine}.


\subsection*{Transitions - 20 mins}
Revise transitions.
It's best to take this section on a skater by skater basis, a selection of drills is \hyperref[[drill:transitions/staggered]{provided}.

The goal is to move from transitions to turn around toe-stops.
