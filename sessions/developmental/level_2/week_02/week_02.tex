\noindent 

This session is a developmental session focused on weight transfer skills, building on powerslides, laterals and transitions. 

\section*{Overview}

{\bf Training Preamble}
This is the second `return to level 2' session, in which we will begin working on skills not covered in level 1 without beginning contact training. 
The warm up is extended with an eye to continuing to develop skills from previous weeks.

\subsection*{Extended Warm-Up - 45 Mins}

Initial warm-up, break regularly for water during the warm up.

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf Prelude} - 15 minutes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sticky skating - Regular, large, fast and figure 8 eggshells.
    \item Weaves - 1 lane, 2 lanes
    \item Carves - half track, line to line
    \item 3 Warm Laps
    \item One foot glides - aim for at least along the straight 
    \item 2 Medium-hot laps
    \item Backwards sticky skating -  Regular, large, fast and figure 8 eggshells - expect difficulty with the figure 8s
    \item 1 Fast lap
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf Middle Eight} - 10 minutes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stepping
    \item Toe stop walking  
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}
{\bf Coda} - 10 minutes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops 
    \item T Stops
    \item Turn-around toe stops, transition work if not ready
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Revision - 30 Mins}
\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf Falling} - 5 minutes:\\
Run as a two sides of the track drill - one side with one fall, the other with the other.
Don't run this drill for too long, especially if skaters have poor kneepads.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[drill:falls/knee_taps]{Knee taps} and \hyperref[drill:falls/double_knee]{Double knee taps}
    \item \hyperref[drill:fall/turtle]{Turtle falls} and \hyperref[drill:falls/slide]{Slide falls}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf \hyperref[drill:sticky/eggshells/one_edge]{Sticky skating revision}} - 5 minutes:\\ 
Focusing on making sure that all edges are being used and start working on derby stance.

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf One Foot Skating} - 10 minutes:
Looking at either gliding or starting to integrate edge-work, depending on where the skater's development is at.
Focus can either be on \hyperref[drill:one_foot/circles]{single foot circles} or \hyperref[drill:one_foot/serpentine]{serpentine}.

\subsection*{Weight Transfer - 45 Mins}

This week is focused on weight transfer skills. 
This skirts around the space occupied by power-slides, transitions and laterals.

At this stage allow a power-slide or plough stop to the lateral rather than expecting a stomp stop.
This blends better with the other skills that are being focused on.

\hyperref[drill:laterals/developmental_balancing]{Open Hip Balancing}
An open hip balancing drill, this will be useful for the skills in this section. 

\hyperref[drill:laterals/developmental/push_and_glide]{Open Hip Gliding} - One foot glides while facing perpendicular to the direction of travel.

\hyperref[drill:laterals/developmental/weight_transfer_static]{Static weight transfer} - Stepping through the foot and weight distributions required for a lateral. 

\hyperref[drill:laterals/developmental/weight_transfer_rolling]{Rolling weight transfer} - Combining the previous two drills, this ends up being a mini transition. Should be performed both laterally and while skating down the track. 

\hyperref[drill:footwork/alternating_powerslides]{Alternating Powerslides}:
Introduction or revision on powerslides.
The goal here is to work on a slurry of weight transfer skills that build into laterals and transitions.
