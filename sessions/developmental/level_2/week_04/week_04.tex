\noindent 

This session is focused around continuing to develop skating skill while acclimatising skaters to skating in proximity. 

\section*{Overview}

{\bf Training Preamble}
The warm up is extended with an eye to continuing to develop skills from previous weeks.

\subsection*{Extended Warm-Up - 35 Mins}

Initial warm-up, break regularly for water during the warm up.

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf Prelude} - 15 minutes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sticky skating - Regular, large and figure 8 eggshells.
    \item Weaves - 1 lane, 2 lanes
    \item Carves - half track, line to line
    \item 3 Warm Laps
    \item One foot glides, starting to work on engaging edges and controlling movement if appropriate, otherwise aiming for at least three quarters of the track on one glide.  
    \item 2 Medium-hot laps
    \item Backwards sticky skating -  Regular, large, fast and figure 8 eggshells - expect difficulty with the figure 8s
    \item 1 Fast lap
\end{itemize}

{\bf Middle Eight: Static Movement Skills} - 10 minutes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stepping
    \item Side shuffles
    \item Toe stop walking 
    \item Toe stop side shuffles 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25cm}
{\bf Coda: Stopping Skills} - 10 minutes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops 
    \item T Stops
    \item Turn-around toe stops, transition work if not ready
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Revision - 25 Minutes}

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf One Foot Skating} - 10 minutes:
Looking at either gliding or starting to integrate edge-work, depending on where the skater's development is at.
Focus can either be on \hyperref[drill:one_foot/circles]{single foot circles} or \hyperref[drill:one_foot/serpentine]{serpentine}.
At this stage some skaters may be starting to develop self-propelled one-foot skating.  
Those skaters should focus on drills involving self propelled one foot weaves, and others involving large movements and tight turns without self propelling.

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf \hyperref[drill:footwork/alternating_powerslides]{Alternating Power-slides} - 10 Minutes}
Revision on power-slides, this will be integrated into the warm-up in following weeks. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

{\bf Mirrored Laterals}
This drill is currently aspirational and may devolve to regular lateral technique practice depending on the skater's development. 
Depending on progress this might be a time to start introducing stomp stop laterals to compliment plough stop laterals. 



\subsection*{New Skills - 25 Minutes}
