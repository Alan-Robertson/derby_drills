\title{Edgework Jamming}

\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent 

This session is focused on jamming techniques using edgework.
The primary goal of these techniques is to leverage the blocker's momentum using faster turning rates to leave them unable to zone the jammer.     

These techniques work best if the jammer or the wall is in motion.

\section*{Warm-up}
\label{sec:warmup}

\subsection*{Sticky Skating}
\label{drill:sticky:eggshells}

Regular sticky skating
\begin{itemize}
\item Eggshells 
\item Figure 8 Eggshells
\item Wide Eggshells
\item Small and Fast
\end{itemize}
Forwards and backwards

\subsection*{Carves and Weaves [Variant]}
\label{drill:sticky:carves_and_weaves}
Weaving should focus on sharp hip movements, keeping feet close together and sharpness of edges. More experienced skaters are encouraged to try to maintain an edge on the inside two wheels of each skate.     
Carving should focus on the sharpness of the carve while maintaining speed.
This includes a variant carving warm-up. 
Skaters should perform a cross-over or backwards cross over between each carve.
The goal should be to establish a good carving form at a given speed, then increase the speed until form is lost, work at that speed to re-establish form and repeat.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 1 lane 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 2 lanes
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving + Crossovers, 2 lanes 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving + Crossovers, line to line
\end{itemize}

As before this should be repeated skating forwards and backwards

\subsection*{One Foot [Variant]}
\label{drill:one_foot:serpentine}
As a progression between gliding and self propelled one footed skating this warm up borrows from introductory artistic skating.
The core idea is rather than locking in the foot to a glide that developing skaters need to start using their edges on one foot to make the necessary turns.     

Skaters should pick up momentum and then skate from line to line in a serpentine motion on one foot. When they run out of momentum they may change feet. Doing this backwards may be challenging on the track so it is recommended that initially regular backwards one foot drills be used. 

Progression of this drill is in sharpening angles, maintaining momentum and incorporating self-propelled motions.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2\times$ laps serpentine one foot forwards 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap one foot glides/self propelled backwards 
\end{itemize}


\section*{Stopping Drill}
\label{drill:stopping:jackie_daniels}
Basic Jackie Daniel's drill.

More experienced skaters should focus on decreasing stopping distance, then on increasing speed

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops - More experienced skaters should focus on one footed plough stops, emphasis should be on form, then stopping distance, then speed 
    \item T stops (may be excised for time constraints) - experienced skaters should focus on T stop variants (out to the side, and out in front)  
    \item Turn around toe stops [Variant] - Skaters should focus on eliminating slide with increasing speed. Skaters should also focus on lunging out of the stop.  
    \item Hockey stops - Less experienced skaters may substitute with more turn around toe stops 
\end{itemize}
