\title{Three Walls, Pockets and Shelving}

\noindent 

Focus of this session is about getting back to three walls.
Most of these drills are blocker focused, but jammers should be working on shelving.


\section*{Overview}

\subsection*{Off Skates Warm-up 5-10 Minutes Before the Session}
Lightly making sure that the joints still work.

Focus is {\bf not} on building strength, cardio or endurance, just on limbering up. Do 5 to 10 reps of each, on each side. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Toe taps + one leg light squats
\item Arm, shoulder and neck stretches
\item Opening and closing hip rotations
\item Knee raise to superman 
\item Cross chest knee raises
\item Butt kicks, high knees, side shuffles
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Basic Warm-up - 15 minutes}

Mostly standard edge-work warm-up. Stage in faster laps rather than doing them all at once.
Do forwards and backwards.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sticky skating - Regular, Figure 8, low
\item Regular weaves + carves
\item One foot line-to-line (it not able, then \hyperref[drill:one_foot/serpentine]{serpentine}). 
\item One foot lateral 
\item Fast laps 
\item Stops
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Edge-work - 20 minutes}
A bit of edge-work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[drill:one_foot/circles]{One foot circles}.
    \item \hyperref[drill:footwork/alternating_hockeys]{Drop step or Lateral stopping drill}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Contact Warm Up - 10 minutes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depending on numbers, either Spaghetti-meatballs or just one-on-one.
    \item Jammer and a three wall
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Shelving, Driving and Taking Position - 20 minutes}
An extension of taking position from other skaters.

\begin{itemize}
\item Drive one skater to the line and out
\item Load drive one skater to pass them.
\item Drive a two wall 20 foot or until it breaks 
\item Drive a three wall 20 foot or until it breaks
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Pocketing - 20 minutes}
Three wall drill
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jammers are looking to shelve and drive the wall 30 foot. 
    \item Blockers are attempting to pocket and drive the jammer to the line.
    \item If in the last 10 feet, controlled hit out on the jammer and reset. 
\end{itemize}

Numbers permitting, run two walls at once and use pack to determine what to do with the jammer, otherwise use a marker.




\subsection*{Four Walls}

{\bf Four wall drill}. 
The same as the above, with a solid three wall, and a fourth blocker. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the other wall is close, with no pack considerations, the fourth skater should pocket.
    \item The the other wall is ahead, then the fourth skater should comms and be ready to bridge. The wall then takes over pocket duties. 
    \item If the wall is at the front the fourth skater should comms from behind the wall, and be ready to bridge. The wall takes over pocket duties. 
\end{itemize}
Numbers permitting, run two walls at once and use pack to determine what to do with the jammer. Otherwise use a marker.




\subsection*{Finnish Pace Line}
And back to some more dynamic movement drills.
