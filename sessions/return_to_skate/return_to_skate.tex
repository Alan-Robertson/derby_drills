Getting back in the groove.
This is a 2 hour warm up and skills session.

\section*{Overview}

\subsection*{Off Skates Warm-up 5-10 Minutes}
Lightly making sure that the joints still work.

Focus is {\bf not} on building strength, cardio or endurance, just on limbering up. Do 5 to 10 reps of each, on each side. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Toe taps + one leg light squats
\item Arm, shoulder and neck stretches
\item Opening and closing hip rotations
\item Knee raise to superman 
\item Cross chest knee raises
\item Butt kicks, high knees, side shuffles
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Basic Edges - 15 Minutes}

Mostly standard edge-work warm-up. Stage in faster laps rather than doing them all at once.
Do forwards and backwards.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sticky skating, one edge at a time
\item Three moderate pace laps
\item Regular weaves + carves
\item Two faster paced laps
\item One foot line-to-line 
\item One foot self-propelled (it not able, then serpentine). 
\item One fast lap
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Hip Flexors}

Having locked in our edges, now some work on the hips.

\begin{itemize}
\item Lateral one foot skating, forwards and back foot, facing inside and outside line.
\item Side surfing.
\item Basic transitions. More experienced skaters can warm up different transition variants.

\item Three moderate pace laps
\item Regular weaves + carves
\item Two faster paced laps
\item One foot line-to-line 
\item One foot self-propelled (it not able, then serpentine). 
\item One fast lap
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Warm-up}
\label{sec:warmup}

\subsection*{Sticky Skating}
\label{drill:sticky:eggshells}

Regular sticky skating
\begin{itemize}
\item Eggshells 
\item Figure 8 Eggshells
\item Wide Eggshells
\item Small and Fast
\end{itemize}
Forwards and backwards

\subsection*{Carves and Weaves [Variant]}
\label{drill:sticky:carves_and_weaves}
Weaving should focus on sharp hip movements, keeping feet close together and sharpness of edges. More experienced skaters are encouraged to try to maintain an edge on the inside two wheels of each skate.     
Carving should focus on the sharpness of the carve while maintaining speed.
This includes a variant carving warm-up. 
Skaters should perform a cross-over or backwards cross over between each carve.
The goal should be to establish a good carving form at a given speed, then increase the speed until form is lost, work at that speed to re-establish form and repeat.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 1 lane 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap weaving, 2 lanes
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving + Crossovers, 2 lanes 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap carving + Crossovers, line to line
\end{itemize}

As before this should be repeated skating forwards and backwards

\subsection*{One Foot [Variant]}
\label{drill:one_foot:serpentine}
As a progression between gliding and self propelled one footed skating this warm up borrows from introductory artistic skating.
The core idea is rather than locking in the foot to a glide that developing skaters need to start using their edges on one foot to make the necessary turns.     

Skaters should pick up momentum and then skate from line to line in a serpentine motion on one foot. When they run out of momentum they may change feet. Doing this backwards may be challenging on the track so it is recommended that initially regular backwards one foot drills be used. 

Progression of this drill is in sharpening angles, maintaining momentum and incorporating self-propelled motions.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2\times$ laps serpentine one foot forwards 
    \item $\frac{1}{2}\times$ lap one foot glides/self propelled backwards 
\end{itemize}


\section*{Stopping Drill}
\label{drill:stopping:jackie_daniels}
Basic Jackie Daniel's drill.

More experienced skaters should focus on decreasing stopping distance, then on increasing speed

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plough stops - More experienced skaters should focus on one footed plough stops, emphasis should be on form, then stopping distance, then speed 
    \item T stops (may be excised for time constraints) - experienced skaters should focus on T stop variants (out to the side, and out in front)  
    \item Turn around toe stops [Variant] - Skaters should focus on eliminating slide with increasing speed. Skaters should also focus on lunging out of the stop.  
    \item Hockey stops - Less experienced skaters may substitute with more turn around toe stops 
\end{itemize}
