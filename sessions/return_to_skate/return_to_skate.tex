\noindent 

Getting back in the groove.
This is a 2 hour warm up and skills session.
Drills are focused on limbering up, and should not include power or finicky techniques. 
More complex drills should be based around the combination of basic skills.



\section*{Overview}

\subsection*{Off Skates Warm-up 5-10 Minutes}
Lightly making sure that the joints still work.

Focus is {\bf not} on building strength, cardio or endurance, just on limbering up. Do 5 to 10 reps of each, on each side. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Toe taps + one leg light squats
\item Arm, shoulder and neck stretches
\item Opening and closing hip rotations
\item Knee raise to superman 
\item Cross chest knee raises
\item Butt kicks, high knees, side shuffles
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Basic Edges - 15 Minutes}

Mostly standard edge-work warm-up. Stage in faster laps rather than doing them all at once.
Do forwards and backwards.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sticky skating - Regular, Figure 8, low
\item Three moderate pace laps
\item Regular weaves + carves
\item Two faster paced laps
\item One foot line-to-line 
\item One foot self-propelled (it not able, then \hyperref[drill:one_foot/serpentine]{serpentine}). 
\item One fast lap
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Hip Flexors - 20 minutes}

Having warmed up our edges, we now start working on the hips.

\begin{itemize}
\item Lateral one foot skating, forwards and back foot, facing inside and outside line.
\item Side surfing.
\item Basic Laterals
\item Transition variants, warm up then start looking for new ones. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Stopping Drills - 10 minutes}
In pairs around the track. Focus is on getting comfortable, then decreasing stopping distance.

\begin{itemize}
    \item One and two foot ploughs 
    \item T stops - Back, side and front 
    \item Turn around toe stops
    \item Powerslides
    \item Hockey stops
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Toe Stops - 15 minutes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weight transfer and walking
    \item Side shuffles
    \item Grapevines
    \item \hyperref[sec:toe_stop/skating_to_toe]{Skating to toe stops \& back}. (Backwards, Forwards and Side-surf) )
    \item Derby Stops % TODO
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Edgework - 20 minutes}
A return to our edges for a bit. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[drill:one_foot/circles]{One foot circles}.
    \item Stationary carves. 
    \item One-foot C-cuts, drop step, alternating. 
    \item One-foot U-cuts, drop step, alternating. 
    \item \hyperref[drill:footwork/alternating_hockeys]{Drop step or Lateral stopping drill}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dynamic Movement - 15 minutes}
And back to some more dynamic movement drills.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Side surf leg alternation 
    \item Stroked side surfing 
    \item Side surf serial quarter rotations.
    \item \hyperref[drill:footwork/finnish]{Finnish Snake drill}
\end{itemize}
